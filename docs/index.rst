🌐 TopoX 🍩
===========

`TopoX` is a Python package for computations, machine learning and deep learning on topological domains.

Many natural systems as diverse as social networks and proteins are characterized by relational structure. This is the structure of interactions between
components in the system, such as social interactions between individuals or electrostatic interactions between atoms.

`TopoX` provides a unifying interface to compute with such relational data.
