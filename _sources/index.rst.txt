===========

`TopoX` are a set of Python packages for meeting diverse computational needs on topological domains. Topological domains are the natural mathematical structures representing relations between the components of a dataset.

Many natural systems as diverse as social networks and proteins are characterized by relational structure. This is the structure of interactions between
components in the system, such as social interactions between individuals or electrostatic interactions between atoms.

`TopoX` provides a unifying interface to compute and learn with such relational data.

游꿢 Scope and functionality
--------------------------

`TopoX` are a set of packages for computing with topological domains and studying their properties.

It consists of three different packages:

- `TopoNetX` (TNX) which introduces a NetworkX like interface for topological domains.

- `TopoModelX` (TMX) which implements deep learning on topological domains.
   Jump to detailed documentation for the `TopoModelX <https://pyt-team.github.io/topomodelx>`_.

- `TopoEmbedX` (TEX) which provides methods for generating embeddings on topological domains.
